# Decision Queue

This queue records unresolved product, UX, architecture, security, destructive-operation, production, and phase decisions for the Human Product Owner or another explicitly authorized decision-maker.

An unresolved decision affects only the tasks listed in **Blocks**. It must never pause unrelated runnable work. READY tasks with satisfied dependencies may proceed while a decision is pending.

## Queue Statuses

- OPEN — awaiting an authorized decision.
- DECIDED — recorded here and, where durable, in DECISIONS.md.
- WITHDRAWN — no longer applicable.
