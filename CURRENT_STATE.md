# RTFTT Transcribe AI — Current State

Last Updated: 2026-09-11

## Current Branch

setup/ai-development-os

## Current Authorized Phase

Phase 1 — Application Foundation + Full Clickable Prototype

Status: IN PROGRESS

## Baseline Verification

Latest full test suite:

- 134 passed
- 1 skipped
- 333 assertions

Run during TASK-003 implementation and independently re-run by Claude Code; recorded in tasks/TASK-003-complete-prototype-action-wiring.md and reviews/TASK-003-review.md. Supersedes the previous 130-passed/1-skipped/322-assertion baseline.

Skipped test:

Two-factor authentication flow because the Fortify
two-factor-authentication feature is intentionally not enabled.

## Current Implementation

Phase 1 foundation currently includes:

- authentication
- admin/user roles
- authorization and ownership isolation
- MediaFile domain
- Transcription domain
- TranscriptionSegment domain
- ProcessingJob domain
- Folder domain
- dashboard
- transcription pages
- media pages
- processing job pages
- settings
- realistic demo data
- transcript export
- prototype transcription workflow

## Active Task

None.

## Tasks In Review

None.

## Ready Tasks

TASK-003A - Expand Query-Parameter Modal Coverage (READY).

Task: tasks/TASK-003A-expand-query-parameter-modal-coverage.md

Implementation Owner: UNASSIGNED

Reviewer: UNASSIGNED

Follow-up for the LOW finding in reviews/TASK-003-review.md. Not started; no application code or tests changed.

## Completed Tasks

TASK-000 - Multi-Agent Handoff Test (DONE).

Task: tasks/TASK-000-agent-handoff-test.md

Implementation Owner: Codex

Independently VERIFIED by Claude Code in reviews/TASK-000-review.md.

No outstanding findings.

Repository-artifact handoff test completed and closed after verification.

TASK-001 - Enforce Media-Folder Ownership (DONE).

Task: tasks/TASK-001-enforce-media-folder-ownership.md

Implementation Owner: Codex

Independently VERIFIED by Claude Code in reviews/TASK-001-review.md.

Both controller and Livewire move paths require a destination belonging to the media owner. Admin management within the media owner's folders and null/root moves are preserved. Independently re-verified: focused suite 40 passed/100 assertions; full suite 122 passed/1 pre-existing skip/0 failures (no regressions); Pint passed. No outstanding BLOCKER or HIGH findings. Closed as DONE under the user's explicit instruction after confirming the independent VERIFIED review. The review artifact is preserved unchanged.

TASK-002 - Align Media Lifecycle and Display Names (DONE).

Task: tasks/TASK-002-align-media-lifecycle-and-display-names.md

Implementation Owner: Codex

Independently VERIFIED by Claude Code in reviews/TASK-002-review.md.

Media display-name accessor now correctly returns the persisted value (independently forensically confirmed the old accessor silently always fell back to original_filename even when a custom name was persisted — a real, previously-undetected, app-wide bug now fixed). Controller and active Livewire deletion paths both require explicit `accepted` cascade confirmation when transcriptions exist, satisfying ADR-005; the DB-level cascade chain (MediaFile -> Transcription -> TranscriptionSegment/ProcessingJob) was confirmed intact via migration inspection. Independently re-verified: focused suite 28 passed/89 assertions; full suite 129 passed/1 pre-existing skip/0 failures; Pint passed. One MEDIUM, non-blocking finding was preserved and resolved by TASK-002A: Livewire's destroy() now re-queries instead of checking a stale relation. Closed as DONE after confirming the independent VERIFIED review; follow-up TASK-002A is also DONE.

TASK-002A - Refresh Livewire Deletion State Before Cascade Confirmation (DONE).

Task: tasks/TASK-002A-livewire-deletion-race-window.md

Implementation Owner: Codex

Independently VERIFIED by Claude Code in reviews/TASK-002A-review.md.

Closes Finding 1 from reviews/TASK-002-review.md: Livewire's destroy() now checks `$this->mediaFile->transcriptions()->exists()` (a fresh query) instead of the relation collection cached at mount time. A new regression test creates a transcription after mount and before deletion and confirms cascade confirmation is now correctly required; independently traced and confirmed this test would have failed against the pre-fix code. Independently re-verified: focused suite 29 passed/93 assertions; full suite 130 passed/1 pre-existing skip/0 failures; Pint passed. One LOW, non-blocking documentation finding is preserved: the task's static-analysis checkbox overstated the PHPStan state; PHPStan shows only the same two pre-existing, unrelated issues documented in the Phase 1 baseline. Closed as DONE after confirming the independent VERIFIED review; the review artifact is preserved.

TASK-003 - Complete Prototype Action Wiring (DONE).

Task: tasks/TASK-003-complete-prototype-action-wiring.md

Implementation Owner: Codex

Independently VERIFIED by Claude Code in reviews/TASK-003-review.md.

Confirmed the previously dead media-list menu actions (Rename/Move/Delete dispatched a non-existent `openModal` event) and the dead transcription-list Rename link (`#rename` fragment with no listener) are now wired to their existing modal states via query parameters (`media.show?action=...`, `transcriptions.show?rename=1`) consumed by `Show::mount()` and the existing Alpine state respectively. Added a session-flash success banner to `sidebar.blade.php`, confirmed as the real live application shell (`layouts/app.blade.php` wraps every authenticated page in it), surfacing plain-controller redirect feedback that Livewire's toast system cannot catch. Independently re-verified: focused suite 41 passed/123 assertions; full suite 134 passed/1 pre-existing skip/0 failures; Pint passed; no new PHPStan findings. One LOW, non-blocking finding is preserved: the Livewire query-param test only directly covers the `rename` branch, not `move`/`delete` (structurally identical, low risk). Closed as DONE after confirming the independent VERIFIED review; the review artifact is preserved.

## Blocked Tasks

None.

## Decisions Required

None.

## Known Issues

Targeted PHPStan still reports three pre-existing typing issues in unchanged declarations: MediaActionController::download() return type, Show::$folders iterable value type, and Show::render() return type. Confirmed still present and unrelated to TASK-001 in reviews/TASK-001-review.md. This does not establish full Phase 1 completion; other completion-audit findings remain outside TASK-001.

## Next Action

No active task. TASK-003A is READY and unstarted. TASK-004 and Phase 2 remain unauthorized.

## Phase Authorization

Phase 2 and later phases remain NOT AUTHORIZED.
